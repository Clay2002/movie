Movie's I've Watched Project.



Just a project to pratice html, css and javascript and responive design! 

First time using javascript and mainly focus is the dom adding divs and styling in javascript.
Very confused at first but getting the hang with adding differnt html elements in javascript.
Also added some functions in javascript that add and delete some html connected with onclick. 
First time also making something that is responive. The goal was to make the page look good on my mac screen and also my iphone 13 pro screen.
I will need a lot of work with the responive and javascript part which it what Ill be doing after I finshish this project.
I want to add more and more things to the project like dark mode and other coool features just to pratice and learn more skills. 
As I am writing this, I am around half way done and Im thinking the full project will take me around 10-15 hours which is a lot for such a small project but for me this is a huge project since the pass my longest project took me less than 1-2 hours. I want 4 good projects that I will put on my portfolio. I will add this as my first project but later will remove it for a better project in the future.(hopefully)


Just added some css and button hover animations that change the size color and text bold with a nice easy in animation. After this I dont really feel that motavated to add anything else on the project. A lot of bugs are on the page that I can fix and I know how to but it just seems like its going to take another 3 hours to do all the bug fixes. I dont wanna get burned out from coding so I am just going to start this project. I can always go back and fix and add things later if I want.(prob wont ha..) 

Overall things Ive learned - JS DOM, Responvise Design and JS functions. 

I am going to map up another project on the GitHub project tab so I know what I want and what needs to be worked on. 

My next task is to learn JavaScript and make super small projects and pratice with the new things I learn. After doing so, I am going to make my second project that will probably be a lot more complex and take longer then this one. Overall happy with this project and looking foward to compare it to my next project to see how much better ive improved ! :)
