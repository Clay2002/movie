Movie's I've Watched Project.



Just a project to pratice html, css and javascript and responive design! 

First time using javascript and mainly focus is the dom adding divs and styling in javascript.
Very confused at first but getting the hang with adding differnt html elements in javascript.
Also added some functions in javascript that add and delete some html connected with onclick. 
First time also making something that is responive. The goal was to make the page look good on my mac screen and also my iphone 13 pro screen.
I will need a lot of work with the responive and javascript part which it what Ill be doing after I finshish this project.
I want to add more and more things to the project like dark mode and other coool features just to pratice and learn more skills. 
As I am writing this, I am around half way done and Im thinking the full project will take me around 10-15 hours which is a lot for such a small project but for me this is a huge project since the pass my longest project took me less than 1-2 hours. I want 4 good projects that I will put on my portfolio. I will add this as my first project but later will remove it for a better project in the future.(hopefully)
